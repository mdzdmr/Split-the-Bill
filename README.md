# Split the Bill

## Introduction

"Split the Bill" is a project designed to help users fairly divide the cost of a meal at a restaurant when it's unclear who ordered what. This situation often arises during group meals where the billing can get complicated. This project provides a software solution that calculates potential item groupings that each person can pay for to meet predetermined payment amounts.

## Project Background

In scenarios where patrons of a restaurant need to split the bill but prefer not to divide it evenly due to personal budget constraints, our software provides a way to allocate whole items to individuals such that the total paid by each person aligns with agreed amounts. The algorithm uses a recursive approach to determine feasible splits if they exist.

## Features

- Recursive algorithm to find possible bill splits based on item costs.
- Data structure management to efficiently handle multiple item costs.
- Interface for users to input costs and desired payment amounts.
